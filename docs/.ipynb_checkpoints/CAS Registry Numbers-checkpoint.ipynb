    "It can be handy to load tables that contain CAS numbers into spreadsheets such as Excel or OpenOffice Calc or Google Sheets. There is one quirk to be aware of:  most spreadsheets try to interpret incoming data in an intelligent way. Unfortunately, SOME CAS numbers may be translated into dates! For example, in OpenOffice the valid CAS number, **139-08-2**, is reintrepreted to **8/02/39**.  Excel does a similar thing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent the spreadsheet from mangling your CAS numbers, upon importing the data, specify that the CAS column is \"text\".  This will prevent the spreadsheet from re-interpreting your data. Some spreadheet programs have a checkbox for detecting \"special numbers.\"  Turn that OFF.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, most data in FracFocus and Open-FF is saved in the 'csv' format. The default is for commas to separate columns and for quotes to surround a value if it might be misinterpreted.  However, because so many chemical names have commas and single and double quotes within them, there can be considerable confusion if we were to use the default.  Instead, we use the dollar sign as a quoting character ($) when chemical names are involved to prevent those problems. You will have to specify to your spreadsheet program that is the quoting character when importing these files."

This will include bona fide CAS Registration numbers, as well as poorly formed CAS numbers, text to indicate proprietary claims, non-CAS text, and empty values.  This master list will serve as our translation table - FROM: what was published in the raw FracFocus TO: our best guess for the actual identification of the chemical in every record.  Unfortunately, some of those guesses will be \"CAS unresolved.\"\n",

Image This will give us a list of authenticated CAS numbers, deprecated numbers (with their correct replacement number) and \"empty\" numbers, that is CAS codes that are valid in the formal sense, but don't actually refer to any chemicals.  To get this link, we manually test every CASNumber on the master list with a substance search at SciFinder, the CAS search engine.  The results are compiled into a CAS_reference table that can use to identify authentic, deprecated and empty CAS values for our master list.\n",
